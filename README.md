Create a \`.env\` file in the project's root directory (base directory), and add \`DEBUG\`, \`ALLOWED_HOSTS\`, \`SECURITY_KEY\`, \`EMAIL_HOST_USER\`, and \`EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD\`.

This project uses CCS Single Sign On (SSO) for user authentication. You would be required to add \`JWT_SECRET_KEY\` to the \`.env\` aswell which would be equal to the application's client secret created on CCS Auth portal.

You would also be required to add \`PHONEPE_MERCHANT_ID\` and \`PHONEPE_SALT_KEY\` for the utilisation of PhonePe Payment Gateway.

At last, you would be required to add the database credentials in the \`.env\` file aswell, which includes the fields \`DATABASE_URL\`, \`POSTGRES_NAME\`,\`POSTGRES_USER\`, \`POSTGRES_PASSWORD\`, \`POSTGRES_HOST\`, and \`POSTGRES_PORT\`.
