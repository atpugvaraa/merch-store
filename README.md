## Run Locally

### Clone this project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/creative-computing-society/merch-store.git
```

### To start the frontend server

Go to project directory

```sh
cd frontend
```

Install the project dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

Run the start script

```sh
npm run dev
```

### To start the backend server

Go to the project directory

```sh
cd backend/config
```

We recommend you to use a virtual environment

```sh
python -m venv env
```

Activate virtual environment

For Windows PowerShell:

```sh
env/Scripts/activate.ps1
```

For Linux and MacOS:

```sh
source env/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a \`.env\` file in the project's root directory (base directory), and add \`DEBUG\`, \`ALLOWED_HOSTS\`, \`SECURITY_KEY\`, \`EMAIL_HOST_USER\`, and \`EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD\`.

This project uses CCS Single Sign On (SSO) for user authentication. You would be required to add \`JWT_SECRET_KEY\` to the \`.env\` aswell which would be equal to the application's client secret created on CCS Auth portal.

You would also be required to add \`PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY\` and \`PAYU_MERCHANT_SALT\` for the utilisation of PayU Payment Gateway.

At last, you would be required to add the database credentials in the \`.env\` file aswell, which includes the fields \`DATABASE_URL\`, \`POSTGRES_NAME\`,\`POSTGRES_USER\`, \`POSTGRES_PASSWORD\`, \`POSTGRES_HOST\`, and \`POSTGRES_PORT\`.

Run Migrations

```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
```

```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

Start the server

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
